	<h2>Solid State</h2>
	<p>
		Solid State is the state management system that powers Solid Engine applications. It is heavily inspired by <a
			href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, but allows controlled state mutations, on order to achieve the
		level of performance needed for games and other real-time applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		This component is still under development. It is expected to be released as an open source Rust library during
		the fall of 2021. More info to come!

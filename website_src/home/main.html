		<strong>Solid Engine</strong> is an experimental game engine, that forgoes the classic <a
			href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation#Rasterization_of_3D_images">polygon rasterization</a>
		graphics pipeline in favor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">path tracing</a> <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxels</a>.
	<p>
		Representing scenes as solid geometry, quantified as voxels,
		has several advantages. Most notably, intersection testing is very fast, making high quality light transport and
		physics simulations possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rendering scenes by means of path tracing has two major advantages.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Realism.</em> By staying true to the rendering equation, light phenomena such as soft shadows, color
			bleeding and reflections are naturally simulated by the algoritm.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Scalability.</em> The best case time complexity of ray tracing derivatives (incl. path tracing) is
			<code>O(log(n))</code>, where
			<code>n</code> is number of objects in the scene. This opens the door to having very detailed objects and
			scenes.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Combining these advantages can produce stunning graphics with a very distinctive aesthetic, informally
		known as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=voxel+art">voxel art</a>. Up until recently, rendering path
		traced voxel art has been too computation heavy to do in real-time but, advances in consumer graphics cards have
		now made it possible.
	</p>

		<span style="color: var(--nord11);">TL;DR</span> <strong>Solid Engine aims to be the first game engine that can
			render detailed voxel worlds beautifully, in real-time.</strong>

		The engine consists of many parts, of which several are standalone. The different parts are all in
		different stages of development, and follow separate release plans. The long term goal is to
		release all parts as open source software.

	<h2>Solid Editor</h2>
	<p>
		Solid Editor is Solid Engine's custom built voxel graphics editor. It is designed to be a key part of the
		engine's asset pipeline, enabling creation of game-ready voxel graphics assets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides being natively compatible with Solid Engine, the editor sports some generally interesting and unique
		features.
	<ul>
		<li>True <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editing. The editor scene is rendered using
			Solid Engine's path tracer is real time, yielding realistic lighting while editing.</li>
		<li>The possibility to edit voxels directly in 3D, by using any brightly colored ball as a 3D pointing device.

		<li>A novel approach to editor tools. Instead of many different tools with overlapping functionality (e.g. "draw
			square" vs. "select square", or "bucket fill" vs. "magic wand") there is only one, a versatile Selection
			tool. Different effects can be applied to the selected voxels, producing the same results as regular editor
			tools. Combined with real-time effect preview, the user experience is very similar to that of classic
			graphics editors, with the added benefit of being able to tweak every edit before applying it.</li>

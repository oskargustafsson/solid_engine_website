	<h2>Ball Pointer</h2>
	<p>
		The Ball Pointer is a computer vision system, that allows determining a physical ball's position, up to scale.
	</p>
	<p>
		The basic idea is simple, the further away from the camera the ball is, the smaller is will be, giving an
		indication of the ball's distance from the camera. This can be formalized using linear algebra, and then it
		becomes a problem of detecting the ball in an image, for which there are already many solutions.
	</p>

		The Ball Pointer is used by Solid Editor, as a means of drawing voxels in 3D, but could be used for many
		other purposes, e.g. as a cheap replacement for PS Move/Kinect/Wiimote in games. If you want to use it in
		one of your applications today, you can get early-access to the code by making a one-time <a
			href="https://github.com/sponsors/oskargustafsson?frequency=one-time">GitHub Sponsors</a> donation. It will
		be open sourced sooner or later though, probably together with the rest of Solid Engine.

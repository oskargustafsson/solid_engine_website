	<h2>UI</h2>
	<p>
		Solid UI is the custom built UI system for Solid Engine. Its biggest differentiator from other UI systems is
		that its elements are rendered by a GPU path tracer, instead of a rasterizer. This has performance benefits, but
		more importantly, allows the UI to be rendered with realistic light and shadows.
	</p>
	<p>
		This component is still under development. It is expected to be released as an open source Rust library during
		the spring of 2022. More info to come!
